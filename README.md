# Project2

This is a quiz game that is supposed to have sort of a "trivial pursuit feel", it will give you 3 questions at random based on what category and difficulty you select.
You can select a username as well and view statistics for the current session, it does not save any data however so every session is destroyed on page exit or refresh.

## Technologies used
---

### Languages
  * CSS
  * HTML
  * JavaScript

### TBD  
Wanted to do some json and store users and questions with MongoDB, this might still be incorporated, but the scale does not warrant it at this point and would be more of an excercise than actually being useful.


## Pages and Features
---

### Index
  * 1 page for everything, the html needed is generated by script, except for 1 button, the userform, and 1 div.
  * When visited, the site will prompt for a username and then statistics can be saved and viewed in the session (you will need to enter a username every time you leave or refresh the page).
 
### TBD
  Ideally i would use an "empty" HTML page and generate the whole thing through JavaScript, however the button i did with HTML works great as a sort of dev tool for testing things. 
  So im keeping it in for now. 


## User Experience and Design
---

### Overarching Design
  * One "window"(main div) contains everything, text is generated with JavaScript.
  * As simple as possible to start playing, pick a username, a category, a difficulty and you're off.
  * Statistics for current session

### Colours
  * Background is Liberty #6457A6
  * Text is White #FFFFFF
  * Button background is #0C1713
  * On hover, button background will turn to #42BFDD and the text will become black #000000
