## Technologies used
---

* Languages
  * CSS
  * HTML
  * JavaScript

* Wanted to do some json and store users and questions with MongoDB, this might still be incorporated, but the scale does not warrant it at this point and would be more of an excercise than actually being useful.


## Pages and Features
---

* Index
  * 1 page for everything, the html needed is generated by script, except for 1 button, the userform and 3 divs.
  * When visited, the site will prompt for a username and then statistics can be saved and viewed in the session (you will need to enter a username every time).
 
 

## User Experience and Design
---

* Overarching Design
  * One "window"(main div) contains everything, text is generated with JavaScript.
  * As simple as possible to start playing, pick a username, a category, a difficulty and you're off.
  * Statistics for current session

* Colours
  * Background is Liberty #6457A6
  * Text is White #FFFFFF
  * Button background is #0C1713
  * On hover, button background will turn to #42BFDD and the text will become black #000000
